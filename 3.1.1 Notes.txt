***Exploratory Data Analysis***

Goals:
    Summarize main characteristics of the data.
    Gain better understanding of the data set
    Uncover relationships between variables
    Extract important variables

"What are the characteristics that have the most impact on the car price?"

Methods:
*Descriptive statistics
*Grouping with GroupBy
*ANOVA
*Correlation

***Descriptive Statistics***

Describe basic features of data
give short summaries about the sample and measure of the data

describe() function from pandas gives some basic statistics of the data set

categorical data can be looked at witht the value_counts() method

box plots visualizes data distribution and outliers
allows for comparison in distribution between groups

scatter plot shows the relationship between two variables
predictor/independent variable = x-axis
target/dependent variable = y-axis
using the matplotlib function plt.scatter()
always include axis and chart titles

***GroupBy in Python***

dataframe.groupby() method groups by categorical variable
can use single or multiply variables

pivot table: one variable displayed along columns and the other along rows
dataframe.pivot() method

heat map assigns color intensity to a grid based on data at grid points
plt.pcolor() method

***Correlation***

Correlation: Measure to what extent different variables are interdependent
Correlation doesn't imply causation!!!

Positive/Negative linear correlation can be determined via seaborn.regplot()
weak correlations show more or less horizontal regression lines

***Correlation - Statistics***

Pearson correlation gives two features to measure strength of correlation
*Correlation coefficient
    +1 strong positive relationship
     0 no relationship
    -1 strong negative relationship
*P-value
    p < 0.001 strong certainty in the result
    p < 0.05 Moderate Certainty in the result
    p < 0.1 Weak Certainty in the result
    p > 0.1 No certainty in the result

Strong correlation when:
    correlation coefficient is close to 1 or -1
    p value less than 0.001

example:
pearson_coef, p_value = stats.pearsonr(df["horsepower"], df['price'])

you can make a heatmap that incidactes the correlation between each of the
variables with one another

***Analysis of Variance ANOVA***

ANOVA - Statistical comparison of groups
    eg: average price of differennt vehicle makes

Returns:
    F-test score: variation between sample group means divided by variation
        within sample group
    p-value: confidence degree

Small F-test score implies poor correlation between variable categories and
    target variable

Example in Python

# extract make and price data
df_anova = df[["make", "price"]]

# group data by makes
grouped_anova = df_anova.groupby(["make"])

#anova test via f_oneway method in SI/PI package
anova_results_1 = stats.f_oneway(grouped_anova.get_group("honda")["price], grouped_anova.get_group("subaru")["price])
